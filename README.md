# Air_Quality_Index-Prediction.
Develops a hybrid model blending Random Forest regression (for features like PM2.5, NO2, O3, temp) and ARIMA time series forecasting to predict AQI. Involves data preprocessing (lagged features, scaling), model training/evaluation (RMSE, RÂ²), and visualization. Aims for accurate forecasts to support environmental monitoring and policy-making.
